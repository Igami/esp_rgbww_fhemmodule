# RGBWW_fhem_module
an experimental module to drive the RGBWW controllers developed by Patrick Jahns

This modul is very experimental. I mean *very*.


ToDo:

* setting to "on" should fetch the last HSV values and set them rather than setting 60,0,100 (or should it? maybe a default?)
* provide a default transition setting (attr)
